I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics Department at UC Berkeley. I work on topics in labor, education, discrimination, and applied econometrics.

Before my doctoral studies, I was an evaluation specialist in Peru's Ministry of Economics and Finance and research associate at Universidad del Pacífico. I received an MSc degree in Economics at University College London, a Diploma in Applied Mathematics at PUCP, and  B.Sc at Universidad del Pacífico in Peru.

Currently, I am a [WAPPP research fellow](https://wappp.hks.harvard.edu/people/joan-mart%C3%ADnez) at Harvard Kennedy School.
